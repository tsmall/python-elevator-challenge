# Object-oriented Solution

This solution attempts to build a truly object-oriented solution to the
elevator problem. It follows the ideas laid out in [East-Oriented Design][east]
and [Object Calisthenics][cali].

## East Oriented Design

## Object Calisthenics

Object Calisthenics is a set of strict design guidelines that are intended to
help you create truly object-oriented solutions. By that I mean solutions that
follow the intent the creators of object-oriented programming had in mind. And
that means those solutions should therefore get all of the benefits of
object-oriented programming.

* Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
* Donâ€™t Use The ELSE Keyword
* Wrap All Primitives And Strings
* First Class Collections
* One Dot Per Line
* Don't Abbreviate
* Keep All Entities Small
* No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
* No Getters/Setters/Properties
